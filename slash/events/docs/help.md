## Not sure which button to press?

**You should press ‹‹ Yes ›› if:**

* You are currently using laptop/desktop computer. *The link [will not work correctly](https://productforums.google.com/forum/?noredirect=true#!topic/calendar/_DQyxg1eP9g) from a phone/tablet!*
* You use the Google Calendar app on your [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.calendar) or [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-calendar/id909319292?mt=8)
* You visit the [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/) web app to view your calendar

**You should press ‹‹ No ›› if:**

* You use the Calendar app app that came with your [Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202835) or your [iPhone/iPad](https://www.imore.com/calendar)
* You use another app to manage your calendar that is compatible with [iCalendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) file formats*

<sub>*&#42;iCalendar is a standard file format for calendar data. Even though it sounds like an Apple product, it's used by most calendar applications.*</sub>
